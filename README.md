# Project by Montserrat Rodr√≠guez Cepeda :)
- The ai.py module is needed to run the code.
- In order to complete this project I had to install openai, so that the recipes would be given by an artificial inteligence.
- First the code will ask the user to input an action so that they can eauter 1. consult the previous recipes or 2. create a new one
- The if statements are used so that the code branches and exectues a different thing depending on your decision.
- If the user chooses to create a new recipe they must input the ingredients and the difficulty they wish for their recipe to have.
- After this the user will have the option to save their recipe with a name of their preference.
- If the user chooses to consult then the name that it was saved as must be provided as well as the difficulty.
- After this the user will have the option to delete or edit teh difficulty of the recipe.
That is how the code works, please enjoy.
